So far, so good!

I like playing the piano.  I've always enjoyed Skryabin, Rachmaninov, and other Russian composers of the late 19th/early 20th centuries, but I've recently 'discovered' Miaskovskyâ€”still hoping to convince a cellist friend to play Miaskovsky's second cello sonata with me sometime soon...  It's divine!  I also want to interest some singers I know in his songs...  Miaskovsky is called the "father of the Soviet symphony", but so far, I'm just blown away by the chamber music.  I'll get the symphonies soon enough!
